- [ ] Implement proper cleanup on mode changes

#### Step 4.2: Update IPC Communication âœ… PLANNED
- [ ] Add IPC handlers for mode changes
- [ ] Update tray menu to show current mode
- [ ] Add quick mode switching in tray
- [ ] Persist mode selection in settings

#### Step 4.3: State Persistence âœ… PLANNED
- [ ] Save selected mode to user preferences
- [ ] Restore mode on app startup
- [ ] Handle mode conflicts (e.g., timer with activity-only)

**Deliverables**:
- Fully integrated mode switching
- Persistent user preferences
- Updated tray menu functionality

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Days 9-10)
**Goal**: Ensure functionality works across platforms and applications

#### Step 5.1: Platform Testing âœ… PLANNED

- [ ] Test on macOS with various communication apps
- [ ] Test on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora) with different DEs
- [ ] Document platform-specific limitations

#### Step 5.2: Integration Testing âœ… PLANNED
- [ ] Test mode switching during active sessions
- [ ] Test timer functionality with different modes
- [ ] Test system sleep behavior in each mode
- [ ] Verify tray menu synchronization

#### Step 5.3: User Experience Testing âœ… PLANNED
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness and animations
