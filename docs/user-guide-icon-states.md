# NoDoze Icon States - User Guide

## Visual Indicators of NoDoze Status

NoDoze provides visual indicators to show whether sleep prevention is active or inactive. This guide explains how to interpret these indicators.

## System Tray Icon

The primary visual indicator of NoDoze's status is the **system tray icon** (also known as the notification area icon) located in the bottom-right corner of your screen on Windows.

### Active State

When NoDoze is actively preventing your computer from sleeping, the system tray icon will show an "open eye" icon:

- This indicates that sleep prevention is **ACTIVE**
- Your computer will not go to sleep
- The icon is designed to be easily recognizable even at small sizes

### Inactive State

When NoDoze is not preventing your computer from sleeping, the system tray icon will show a "closed eye" icon:

- This indicates that sleep prevention is **INACTIVE** 
- Your computer will follow normal system sleep settings
- The icon is visually distinct from the active state

## Tooltip Information

Hovering your mouse over the NoDoze tray icon will display a tooltip with text that indicates the current status:

- When active: "NoDoze - Sleep Prevention Active"
- When inactive: "NoDoze - Sleep Prevention Inactive"

## Tray Menu Status

Right-clicking on the NoDoze tray icon will display a context menu where you can see and control the application status:

- The "Prevent Sleep" option will have a checkmark next to it when active
- The current sleep prevention mode will be indicated in the Sleep Prevention Mode submenu

## Main Application Window

The main application window also displays the current status with visual indicators:

- The toggle switch position indicates whether sleep prevention is active
- Text labels in the interface confirm the current state
- The selected mode (Basic, Full, Activity Only) is highlighted

## Note About Taskbar Icons

While the system tray icon will always correctly reflect the current NoDoze status, the taskbar icon (the icon in the Windows taskbar) may not always update to match the current state due to Windows' icon caching mechanisms. 

**Please rely on the system tray icon as the authoritative indicator of NoDoze's current status.**
