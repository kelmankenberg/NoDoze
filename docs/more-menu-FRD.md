# NoDoze More Menu - Functional Requirements Document

## Overview

This document defines the requirements for implementing a "More" menu in the NoDoze application. The More menu will be positioned in the title bar near the window control buttons and will provide access to additional features and settings, including a theme toggle option.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Add a More menu to the title bar UI
2. Include a theme toggle feature in the menu
3. Implement Light and Dark mode theme support
4. Ensure all UI elements respect the selected theme

## Functional Requirements

### 1. More Menu UI

#### 1.1 Positioning and Appearance
- The More menu button will be positioned in the title bar, to the left of the window control buttons (minimize, corner, close)
- The button will use a standard "three dots" (ellipsis) icon
- The menu will have a consistent style with the rest of the application
- The menu will appear as a dropdown when clicked

#### 1.2 Menu Behavior
- The menu will open when the user clicks on the More button
- The menu will close when:
  - The user clicks outside the menu
  - The user selects an item from the menu
  - The user clicks the More button again
- The menu will maintain its state (open/closed) when the window is resized

### 2. Theme Toggle Feature

#### 2.1 Theme Support
- The application will support two themes:
  - Light Mode: Default theme with light backgrounds and dark text
  - Dark Mode: Alternative theme with dark backgrounds and light text
- Theme preference will be persisted across application restarts using the SettingsManager

#### 2.2 Theme Toggle UI
- The theme toggle will be an item within the More menu
- The toggle will display the current theme with appropriate icon:
  - Light Mode: Sun icon (‚òÄÔ∏è)
  - Dark Mode: Moon icon (üåô)
- The toggle will have a label indicating the action (e.g., "Switch to Dark Mode" or "Switch to Light Mode")

#### 2.3 Theme Switching
- Clicking the theme toggle will immediately switch between Light and Dark modes
- The theme change will apply to all UI elements without requiring application restart
- Visual feedback will be provided to indicate the theme change
- The menu will close after the theme is changed

### 3. Theme Implementation

#### 3.1 CSS Variables
- Theme colors will be implemented using CSS variables for consistent application
- Variables will include at least:
  - Primary background color
  - Secondary background color
  - Primary text color
  - Secondary text color
  - Accent color
  - Border color
  - Button colors (default, hover, active)

#### 3.2 Theme Application
- All UI components will use the theme variables rather than hardcoded colors
- Transitions between themes will be smooth with a short animation (0.3s)
- Special consideration will be given to ensure readability in both themes

#### 3.3 Components to Theme
- Title bar
- App header
- Main container
- Buttons (activate button, toggle buttons)
- Sleep prevention mode toggle
- Timer section
- About dialog
- Progress bars
- Status indicators

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Component Structure

#### 1.1 React Components
- Create a `MoreMenu` component that will be added to the TitleBar component
- Add a ThemeContext to manage and provide theme information throughout the app
- Update existing components to consume the ThemeContext

#### 1.2 Settings Integration
- Extend the `UserSettings` interface in SettingsManager.ts to include theme preference
- Add theme related methods to SettingsManager:
  - `getTheme(): 'light' | 'dark'`
  - `setTheme(theme: 'light' | 'dark'): void`

#### 1.3 IPC Communication
- Add IPC handlers for theme-related actions:
  - `get-theme-preference` - Retrieve current theme from settings
  - `set-theme-preference` - Update theme in settings

### 2. Theme Implementation

#### 2.1 CSS Structure
- Create a new `theme.css` file with CSS variables for both themes
- Use CSS classes to apply theme variables (`.theme-light`, `.theme-dark`)
- Update existing CSS files to use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors

#### 2.2 Theme Switching Logic
- Apply the theme class to the root HTML element
- Implement smooth transitions between themes
- Ensure all components use themed CSS variables

## UI Mockups

### Title Bar with More Menu Button
```
+----------------------------------------+
| NoDoze                        ‚ãÆ _ ‚ñ° X |
+----------------------------------------+
```

### Open More Menu
```
+----------------------------------------+
| NoDoze                        ‚ãÆ _ ‚ñ° X |
+----------------------------------------+
|                              +--------+
|                              | Switch |
|                              | to Dark|
|                              | Mode ‚òÄÔ∏è|
|                              +--------+
```

### Dark Mode Theme Applied
```
+----------------------------------------+
| NoDoze                        ‚ãÆ _ ‚ñ° X | <- Dark title bar
+----------------------------------------+
| [ACTIVATE]                            | <- Dark background
|                                       | <- Light text
| [Sleep Prevention Mode Toggle]        | <- Themed components
|                                       |
| [Timer Section]                       |
|                                       |
+----------------------------------------+
```
